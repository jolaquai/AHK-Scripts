﻿/**
 * My codebase library for most of my other AHK scripts.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Dates should be interpreted as MM/DD/YYYY or MM/DD/YY.
 *
 * Coding conventions:
 * - The entire library is written to allow for easy modification and expansion, making the functions somewhat prone to changes. The idea is, however, to ensure that either all calls to functions only produce different results while leaving the function's syntax untouched (or only changed so that calls to it do not have to be changed to be valid, such as adding optional parameters), or that a syntax change is easy enough to fix using regex Find-and-Replace.
 * - Most comparisons are hard-coded case-sensitive (operator `==` instead of `=`). This does _not_ apply to functions the express use of which is string comparison, in which case an optional parameter allows for control over this. Most, if not all, default to `true`, i.e. a case-sensitive comparison. Additionally (as per AHKv2 behavior), case-sense is ignored for comparisons where one of the operands is not of type `String` (ex. objects).
 * - String concatenations are / should always be done explicitly: `"string 1" . " " . var` instead of `"string 1" " " var`.
 * - Most, if not all, cases where braces (`{ }`) _may_ be omitted, they _are_ present. I've recently (1/19/2022) noticed some extremely odd behavior relating to `if`s in any form of loop, be it introduced by `Loop` or `for`. The loop would sometimes be left prematurely, even though no `return` or `break` keywords were encountered. Adding braces prevented this from happening, which probably means the AHKv2 parser messes up somewhere and breaks out of the loop if an `if` clause executed incorrectly. It also did not _always_ do this, causing some confusion as to what this "incorrect execution" even is. I still haven't found an answer for that, but omitting braces seems to cause it, which is why I've decided to add them wherever appropriate (or possible, rather), even if this is only technically necessary when there's an `if` construct in the loop: `( {2,})((?:loop|for|if|else|try|catch|while).*\n)(.*)` and `$1$2$1{\n$3\n$1}`.
 * - The "Lower Camel Case" naming convention is followed (e.g. `mapOperations`, not `MapOperations`), except in class definitions when the intention of these is _not_ solely to hold `static` functions and constants, but to actually be instantiated into an object (e.g. `codebase.math.vectorGeometry.Vector`, not `codebase.math.vectorGeometry.vector`).
 * - On 8/19/2022, I made the switch to the `.ahk` file extension. You will very likely have to associate it with your AHKv2 executable in Windows before
 *
 * The functions and some classes are sometimes only annotated, usually fully documented though, using comments, allowing IntelliSense to display parameter and other information. Basically, to get the most out of this, use the following commands (Windows):
 * - `code --install-extension zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug`
 * - `code --install-extension thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp`
 *
 * This "script" is a pure library. While it does technically contain an autorun section to set directives or similar, it will exit immediately upon finishing this.

 * Whether a debugger has been attached to the script since script launch or reload (the latter of which is nearly impossible).
 *
 * Allows full control over what a script does and does not do if a debugger is attached. For example, timers may interrupt debugging sessions if their periods expire while the script is in break mode.
 * @note This is not 100% reliable:
 * - Does not update in real-time (that is also impossible using the method used to determine this, which is the only one there even is, to my knowledge at least).
 * - Does not reflect the actual status if a debugger has attached to a running script.
 * - If the script calls `Reload` or is reloaded through `PostMessage`, a debug session, if any, is terminated. After a reload in this manner, this variable will most likely be `false` unless the reload/restart was caused by the debugger itself.
 *
 * Because of this, it is discouraged to attach a debugger to a script that is running.

             * @param arr A `VarRef` to the Array to be sorted.
             * @param sortDesc Whether to sort the Array in descending order. Defaults to `false` if omitted.
             * @param stringComp Whether to use string comparison for sorting. If omitted, the sort method will be determined automatically from the Array's contents.
             * - Initially, numerical comparison is used.
             * - If any value in `arr` is not a number, string comparison is used instead.
             * @param l The lower index of the range to sort. Defaults to `1` if omitted.
             * @param r The upper index of the range to sort. Defaults to `arr.Length` if omitted.
             * @note When `stringComp` is truthy, `StrCompare` with the `"Logical"` setting is used as the sort callback function. The following problems arise when comparing strings containing both letters _and_ numbers, numerical strings and strings containing _only_ letters:
             * - `"39.21"` is numerically less than, but lexically greater than `"39.3"` (`"39.21" > "39.3"`, but `"39.2" < "39.3"`, _but_ `"39.21" < "39.30"`).
             * - The above applies to mixed strings like `"a39.21"`.
             * - Rules such as `"39.21" < "39.30"` only hold if the compared items are both strings and have the same decimal precision (see 1st bullet).
             * - Pure numbers and numerical strings are considered less than mixed and letter-only strings: `[1, "2.3", 7.33, "a", "b", "b6", "b7", "b7.3", "b7.21", "c"]` (this is "correctly" sorted). This allows sorting floats as strings to prevent floating-point precision errors. To create a string from a float so that it works with this sort function, use `String(Round())` on all floats to be sorted and round them to the _same_ precision.
             * @throws `Error` when attempting to compare strings numerically.
             * @throws `TypeError` if `arr` is not a `VarRef` to an Array.
